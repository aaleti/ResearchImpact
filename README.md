# Purpose of this document

It is often asked from us as researchers to demonstrate the impact of our research. Research impact is vaguely defined in various sources and documents, and many academics (and in particular, early career researchers) find it hard to showcase and measure how their research benefits society. This living document, which will be continuously revised to reflect evolving consensus around research impact and its measures, can be used to guide researchers in showcasing, measuring and encouraging research impact.

We warmly encourage and welcome your input and feedback on this documeny, so please feel free to issue a pull request on the repo, or e-mail us directly.

# What is research impact?
The Australian Research Council (ARC) defines research impact as "Research impact is the contribution that research makes to the economy, society, environment or culture, beyond the contribution to academic research." (https://www.arc.gov.au/policies-strategies/strategy/research-impact-principles-framework). Other definitions of research impact do not specifically exclude the research community. For example, in Horizon 2020, the biggest research funding programme in the world, impact is defined as follows: "Impact broadly defines the wider societal, economic or environmental cumulative changes over a longer period of time.". 

Research impact should not be confused with research results or outcomes, which are means to achive impact. The ARC created a Research Impact Pathway Table, shown below, which provides high level examples from the research pipeline



In order to create impact you need inputs (people, funding, equipment, existing knowledge),  activities (interviews, simulations, tests), outputs (data sets, publications) and outcomes/results (citations, uptake of methodologies, theory, paradigm shift). Impact itself is the bigger change that follows the input, activity, output and outcome. For example, new technologies or discoveries in medicine that have lead to revolutionary changes in the way the world works or treatment of illnesses, such as the invention of batteries or discovery and development of a new drug to cure a deadly disease.
