# Purpose of this document

It is often asked from us as researchers to demonstrate the impact of our research. Research impact is vaguely defined in various sources and documents, and many academics (and in particular, early career researchers) find it hard to showcase and measure how their research benefits society. This living document, which will be continuously revised to reflect evolving consensus around research impact and its measures, can be used to guide researchers in showcasing, measuring and maximising research impact.

We warmly encourage and welcome your input and feedback on this documeny, so please feel free to issue a pull request on the repo, or e-mail us directly.

# What is research impact?

The Australian Research Council (ARC) defines research impact as "Research impact is the contribution that research makes to the economy, society, environment or culture, beyond the contribution to academic research." (https://www.arc.gov.au/policies-strategies/strategy/research-impact-principles-framework). Other definitions of research impact do not specifically exclude the research community. For example, in Horizon 2020, the biggest research funding programme in the world, impact is defined as follows: "Impact broadly defines the wider societal, economic or environmental cumulative changes over a longer period of time.". 

Research impact should not be confused with research results or outcomes, which are means to achive impact. In order to conduct the research and create impact we need input (people, funding, infastructure, existing knowledge),  activities (research work and training, community and stakeholder engagement, simulations, tests), outputs (policy briefings, media, data sets, publications) and outcomes/results (commercial products, citations, uptake of methodologies, theory, paradigm shift, job creation, new companies, etc.). Impact itself is the significant change that follows the input, activity, output and outcome. For example, new technologies or discoveries in software engineering that have lead to revolutionary changes in the way we build software, such as the invention of an automated approach that verifies self-driving cars. Other examples of impact are as follows:

- The invention of a new Machine Learning approach that detects diabetes from blood samples.
- other?

# Measuring Impact



# Stakeholders

Research is often conducted in collaboration with other researchers or parties outside the scientific community. This collaboration could involved technology, data, access to facilities and test subjects, interviewees or patients. These collaborators may not only provide valuable resources needed to carry out the research, but can also benefit from the outcomes of the research directly. These collaborators, partners or customers are often called stakeholders.  

Impactful research and solving global challenges require partnerships between many parties. When recognizing the link between your research and relevant partners, you may also be able to identify new stakeholders for your research. Could there be NGOs or policy makers who would be interested in your research results? We can broadly categorise potential stakeholders as follows:

- **Scientific community**: consists of other researchers in your field or other relevant fields of science that may benefit from your research. This category also includes various research organisations and students. 

- **Policy and decision-makers**: this includes ministries, councils, state government, authorities, special interets groups and standardisation & regulation bodies. 

- **Industry**: means companies and other potential organisations whose interest in the research is product development and who may end up making use of your results commercially. 

- **End-users**: refer to citizens, consumers, NGO's (third sector), communities, museums etc.
