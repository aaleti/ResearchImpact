# The purpose of this document

It is often asked from us as researchers to demonstrate the impact of our research. Research impact is vaguely defined in various sources and documents, and many academics (and in particular, early career researchers) find it hard to showcase and measure how their research benefits society. This living document, which will be continuously revised to reflect evolving consensus around research impact and its measures, can be used to guide researchers in showcasing, measuring and maximising research impact.

We warmly encourage and welcome your input and feedback on this document, so please feel free to issue a pull request on the repo, start an issue, or e-mail us directly.

# What is research impact?

The Australian Research Council (ARC) defines research impact as 
> Research impact is the contribution that research makes to the economy, society, environment or culture, beyond the contribution to academic research. (https://www.arc.gov.au/policies-strategies/strategy/research-impact-principles-framework). 

Other definitions of research impact do not specifically exclude the research community. For example, in Horizon 2020, the biggest research funding programme in the world, impact is defined as follows: 

> Impact broadly defines the wider societal, economic or environmental cumulative changes over a longer period of time. 

Research impact should not be confused with research results or outcomes. To conduct the research, we need input (people, funding, infastructure, existing knowledge). The research involves a set of activities (research work and training, community and stakeholder engagement, simulations, tests), which result in outputs (policy briefings, media, data sets, publications) and outcomes (commercial products, citations, uptake of methodologies, theory, paradigm shift, job creation, new companies, etc.). Impact itself is the significant change that follows the input, activity, output and outcome. For example, new technologies or discoveries in software engineering that have lead to revolutionary changes in the way we build software, such as the invention of an automated approach that verifies self-driving cars. Other examples of impact are as follows:

- The invention of a new Machine Learning approach that detects diabetes from blood samples.
- other?


# Stakeholders

Research is often conducted in collaboration with other researchers or parties outside the scientific community. This collaboration could involved technology, data, access to facilities and test subjects, interviewees or patients. These collaborators may not only provide valuable resources needed to carry out the research, but can also benefit from the outcomes of the research directly. We refer to these collaborators, partners or customers as stakeholders.  

Impactful research and solving global challenges require partnerships between many parties. When recognizing the link between your research and relevant partners, you may also be able to identify new stakeholders for your research. Could there be NGOs or policy makers who would be interested in your research results? We can broadly categorise potential stakeholders as follows:

- **Scientific community**: consists of other researchers in your field or other relevant fields of science that may benefit from your research. This category also includes various research organisations and students. 

- **Policy and decision-makers**: this includes ministries, councils, state government, authorities, special interets groups and standardisation & regulation bodies. 

- **Industry**: means companies and other potential organisations whose interest in the research is product development and who may end up making use of your results commercially. 

- **End-users**: refer to citizens, consumers, NGO's (third sector), communities, museums etc. 


# Measuring Impact

Traditionally, the number of publications and citations have been used as the primary indicators to evaluate research impact. These traditional metrics, however, do not present a complete picture of research impact. Measuring research impact is hard because of its complex nature: impact is the sum of incremental changes that happen over a long period of time, and is often impossible to say which results lead to which changes. The list of metrics below can be used to measure some aspects of impact.

## Quantitative Indicators

### Bibliometrics

- number of publications 
- quality of publications, i.e.  Impact Factor value 
- visibility of publications, i.e. the number of publications in citation databases (Scopus and Web of Science) 
- impact of publications, i.e. the number of citations they have received 
- researcher's H-index 
- researcher's cooperation network, i.e. the number of co-authors and affiliated organizations in publications

### Altmetrics

Altmetrics measure the impact of publications (e.g. articles, books) in social media and other social networking services by tracking for example 
- the number of downloads, 
- mentions on news sites, 
- tweets, 
- likes

Altmetrics demonstrate the impact of publications quicker than traditional citation-based metrics. Tweets and mentions on sites have the potential to accumulate very quickly after publication, whereas citations take months, and sometimes years. 

### Other measures of impact

- IPRs, patents, spin offs, new products, new jobs 
- seminars/workshop organised 
- appearances in social media/press 
- stakeholder contacts 
- International funding applications by the consortium and its researchers 
- courses/seminars organized based on research results 
- participation in committees, councils and working groups (incl. in companies), parliamentary hearings.

## Qualitative Indicators

One of the most effective qualitative tools to showcase the impact of your research is a narrative, such as case studies or impact stories (see reference 2 for examples) describing how your research has benefited the society, economy, culture or environment. Impact stories should, as much as possible, be supported with data and quantitative indicators.
